# GeneticWalk
My first project that deals with genetic algorithm. In this project I tried to implement
some simple pathfinding with genetic algorithm. 

I used OpenGL for fun because I wanted to refresh some 3D knowledge. Based on this simple version I will in the future change the map, put obstacles,
and many more things !
